# PAVA-Comparison
Compare runtime of three R "Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithms" (PAVA) with own implementations in R and Cpp (accessible via Rcpp).

Examine runtime of PAV algorithms for the mean and quantile functionals.

The Cpp implementation is based on the pseudo Code (Algorithm 1) of Gneiting T, Resin J. 2021. Regression diagnostics meets forecast evaluation: conditional calibration,
reliability diagrams, and coefficient of determination. arXiv:2108.03210 [stat.ME]
