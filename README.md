# PAVA_Mean_Comparison
Compare runtime of two R "Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithms" (PAVA) with an implementation in Cpp

The Cpp implementation is based on the pseudo Code (Algorithm 1) of Gneiting T, Resin J. 2021. Regression diagnostics meets forecast evaluation: conditional calibration,
reliability diagrams, and coefficient of determination. arXiv:2108.03210 [stat.ME]
